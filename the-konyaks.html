            Naga people, with their tattooed faces, striking traditional attire and legends of headhunting have
            always been a source of awe and fearful admiration for travellers to the region.</p>

                <p class="text-white">Nagaland has 16 major tribes with several sub-tribes each. Though all of them have warrior
                    lineages, none has a reputation for ferocity like the Konyaks of Mon district. The most feared
                    even among their tribal brethren, they are known to have continued their headhunting ways for
                    many years even after all the others had discontinued the practice.</p>

            <div class="content__2 flex__center__items">
                <p class="text-white">The Konyaks follow a patriarchal system of society. The angh is the chief of the tribe and his
                    jurisdiction extends over many villages. Though they are men of modest means, their authority
                    over these villages is absolute and they have the final say in all matters big and small, even those
                    involving the local government.</p>

        <p class="font-18 font-weight-normal text-white content">The anghs are usually polygamous and one of their wives is the daughter of an angh herself. This
            qualifies her to be the anghya, or the chief wife. Anghship is hereditary and only a son born to an
            anghya can succeed his father. Daughters of anghs can only marry sons of anghs and face
            lifelong banishment if they break this rule. Interestingly, these tribal laws are not a thing of the
            past and are very much in practice even today.

        <p class="font-18 font-weight-normal text-white content">Ask them about their tattoos and you will learn that they are more like war medals than an
            adornment of choice. In days of yore, a battle returned warrior was awarded a v shaped tattoo on
            his chest. Face tattoos were privileges reserved for those returning from battle with trophies of
            enemy heads. The more heads they collected, the more intricate the tattoos became, awarding
            them greater status and esteem in society. These tattoos were etched by the anghya herself, using
            large thorns from the surrounding jungles. The process was painful and sometimes faces stayed
            swollen for days afterwards but it was an honour that the warriors would not give up for
            anything.</p>

                there has been a movement to bury these and do away with the memories of what is today

            <p class="font-18 font-weight-normal text-white content">The Konyaks are natural sculptors. They carve wood, metal and animal bones to make fabulous
                masks and figures, cane baskets, bead and metal jewellery. They are a friendly and hospitable
                people and will be more than happy to give you a demonstration of their sculpting skills. They

            bump into more than a few of them at the local Morung, the traditional Naga centre of learning
            
            or at the angh’s house. They are extremely warm hosts, ever ready to share their tea and
            gooseberries and to pose for photographs with you. In between chatting with visitors, they keep
            going back to making their baskets or sculpting. At Hongphoi, the strict discipline imposed by
            these aged warriors has been critical in keeping the village free from the influence of tobacco and
            opium. At Lungwa, the angh’s house is the chief attraction.</p>

            border with Myanmar which passes right through the angh’s house, bisecting it neatly into two
            halves--you could be sitting in India with your legs stretching into Myanmar while you chat with
            the angh. Resultantly, this angh’s jurisdiction also extends over several villages in Myanmar and
            villagers from there visit him regularly to pay their obeisance. Schools in Lungwa teach the
            Myanmarese script and many young men from the region are enlisted in the Myanmarese army.
            Unfortunately, the open border has facilitated access to opium and despite the effort of some
            women’s groups to restrict its usage, many young men in Lungwa are opium addicts.</p>
